Hereâ€™s a step-by-step roadmap to grab a backend internship at Google as a third-year student:

Step 1: Master Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)

âœ… Practice consistently (Solve at least 300+ Leetcode problems).
âœ… Focus on arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, DP, bit manipulation, and tries.
âœ… Participate in Google Kick Start, Codeforces, and AtCoder.

Step 2: Strengthen Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) & System Design

âœ… Learn SOLID Principles, Design Patterns (Factory, Singleton, Observer, etc.).
âœ… Practice Low-Level Design (LLD) by building real-world applications.
âœ… Study High-Level Design (HLD) (Scalability, Load Balancing, Database Sharding).
âœ… Design Google-scale systems like YouTube, Google Drive, URL Shortener.
